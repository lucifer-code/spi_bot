# QuadBot Project: spi_bot

## Introduction

The **spi_bot** project is an Arduino-based quadruped robot that uses servo motors for locomotion. This project aims to create a versatile and programmable robot that can move on four legs, making it suitable for various applications, including educational purposes, robotics enthusiasts, and experimentation.

## Components

To build the **spi_bot** quadruped robot, you will need the following components:

1. **Arduino Board**: You can use Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, or any compatible board.

2. **Servo Motors**: You will need a minimum of 12 servo motors for controlling the robot's legs and movements.

3. **Chassis**: A sturdy chassis or frame to mount the servo motors and other components securely.

4. **Power Supply**: Depending on your servo motors, you might need an external power supply to provide sufficient power for the servos.

5. **Jumper Wires**: To connect the components and servos to the Arduino board.

6. **Sensors** (optional): You can add sensors like ultrasonic sensors, IR sensors, or cameras for advanced functionality.

7. **Motor Drivers**: If needed, motor drivers to control the servo motors efficiently.

## Features

The **spi_bot** project can be customized and expanded with various features and capabilities, such as:

- **Wireless Control**: Implement wireless communication for remote control using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules.

- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Integrate sensors to enable obstacle avoidance and navigation.

- **Gesture Recognition**: Implement gesture recognition using sensors or cameras for interactive control.

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Develop algorithms for autonomous movement and path planning.

- **Programming**: Create custom behaviors and movements through Arduino programming.
